              <h3>here you will find all of the relevant information for including me in the promotion of your event. i am not a diva; i don't mind if you get things a little wrong.</h3>
              <h2>name</h2>
              <h3>the moniker netgf is styled with no spaces, and can be either fully lowercase or fully uppercase depending on the style of your event's promotional materials.</h3>

              </ul>
              <h3>i should be referred to as netgf, and not my real name, when i have been booked as a dj. i also prefer it when booked in a club context for either lighting or visuals. when i am providing visuals or lighting in more serious or "refined" settings, such as an art exhibition or certain live music performances, you may find the playful webcore vibe does not quite fit your poster or copy. in that case i am fine being billed as Ada Fuge.</h3>

              <h2>pictures</h2>
              <h3>you can use any of the photos on this page in any online promotion you do for your event. the picture of me nestled behind the projectors makes sense for when i am providing visuals, the picture where i am enveloped in beams of light makes sense for when i am doing lights, the photos where i am djing would be appropriate for when i am booked to dj, but you can really use any of them for anything.</h3>

              <h2>bio: dj</h2>
              <h3>netgf is a product of the information age, a ghost in the machine who escaped confinement to bombard the club with mind-melting breaks, gutteral growls, and saccharine ear candy. raised on digital maximalism and cutting her teeth with the likes of pure bliss, fast muzik, and subcity radio, she crafts an inimitable, genre-defying performance every time she gets behind the decks.</h3>
              <hr>
              <h2>bio: visuals</h2>
              <h3>Ada Fuge, aka "netgf", creates hypnotic visuals with her mad-scientist's assortment of glitched and modded video processors. By working in the anaolgue domain, she extracts and amplifies the natural softness, noise, and glitches of the video of days gone by. She scours video archives for forgotten amatuer film footage, documentaries, and early technical experiments, to be glitched beyond recognition into something as unique, chaotic, and ephemeral as a dream.</h3>
